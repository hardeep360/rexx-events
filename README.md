#### Database File Directory: db-source
#### Database Connection File: config.php
#### Version Compare Class: classes/VersionCompare.php
#### Default File: index.php


Event Time is added in the database as it is. So no timezone is changed while adding data in db.
While on displaying date in table format, we are comparing versions with the help of version compare class
and displaying the timezone with time.    

No bootstrap is added for styling of pages. All are added as plain html. So it is very basic.
There is no modals added for db functions. Coding is done on the top of each page.
